I am a mathematician from Shanghai. Currently I am working as a young investigator in Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences, located in the beautiful Jianwang Campus in Fudan University.

My research interest mostly lie in Combinatorics, especially in Graph Theory, in which there are so many elegant problems that is natural, simple and challenging!
